### âœ… **How to Properly Add New Methods:**
When adding new methods to a Python class (like `ReceiveHandler`):

1. **Define the method clearly** within your class using the syntax:
    ```python
    def method_name(self, parameter1, parameter2):
        # method logic
    ```
2. **Ensure correct indentation**: All methods must be indented consistently within the class.
3. **Save the file** after adding the new methods.

### ðŸš© **Final Note:**
Make sure to update your database queries and ensure that your database structure matches the query logic in these new methods. Specifically, verify the existence of columns (`StorageLocation`, `ExpirationDate`, etc.) in your `Inventory` table.
